**: Nate Aurich & Sam Porter Giffords
** Version **: 1.0.0

# Overview
This application is a weblog, encompassing copy, images, and styling.  We are building this app to share Brook's vision of three different versions of Lorum Ipsum with the world.  We also want to make this application using RWD (responsive web design).

## Getting Started
Using the starter code provided, a user needs to add links to several css files, including normalize.css, and icons.css.  They also need to provide css styling in three additional css files, including base, layout, and modules.  An icon (we used a hamburger) is used as a menu placeholder.  

CSS styling will need to be used in order to provide background, text, and image display styles.  

## Architecture
This application makes use of HTML & CSS at this time.  
The IcoMoon library of fonts was also used -- link below in Credits & Collaboration Section

## Change Log
Changes performed on 8 May 2018 - HTML edits
Metatag for viewport was added for RWD.
CSS files were linked in to HTML file.
Hamburger menu icon was linked in from IcoMoon.
HTML file is now functional as requested in lab documentation.
